# Discussion (Plain English)
Basically we went into this experiment saying that in order to accept that caffine affected metabolism, we needed to be at least 95% confident. But when we ran the tests, we found that we were around 94% confident. So we're close, but I wouldn't draw any conclusions just yet. In order to essentially, "break the tie" here, we can go get a bigger sample size and run a few more tests.

# Discussion (Using Scientific Terminology)
From this data we can conclude that caffine does not have
an effect of muscle metabolism. The reason for that lies in the
p-value (0.0606). What this value means is that we are ~94% confident
that our effect is happening. In order to reject our null hypothesis
it is generally accepted that we need to be above 95% confident in our
interaction. Now, that doesn't mean that our research should stop here though.
Clearly our data is indicating that we are extremely close to being confident.
It is still certainly possible that our effect is happening, but maybe we don't
have a large enough sample size. We should calculate how much statistical power
we have, in order to determine the number of samples necessary to be confident that
sample size is not the issue. We could also calculate Cohen's D to observe the effect
size. This statistic does not give us anything that is conclusive, however, effect
size can be helpful to know as a piece of evidence for where to look next. For example,
if the effect size is very large (0.8-1) then maybe we have a Type-1 error. But, if our
effect size is very small (0.1-0.3) then we can probably just accept the null hypothesis.
